Imagine we have a list of jobs, each represented by a character. Because certain jobs must be done before others, a
job may have a dependency on another job. For example, a may depend on b, meaning the final sequence of jobs should
place b before a. If a has no dependency, the position of a in the final sequence does not matter.

The goal of the kata is to parse the job dependency structure and produce a sequence of jobs in the order that observes
their dependency chain.

Start with a method that accepts a single string argument and returns a string which represents the ordered sequence
of jobs (since each job is a single character). Weâ€™ll refine the algorithm by evolving the requirements with each step,
just like the string calculator kata.
