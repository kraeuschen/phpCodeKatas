phpCodeKatas is an Collection of Katas written in PHP.

There are a lot of excercises written in other programming languages,
so i decided to rewrite them into PHP.

Its an great training for TDD, learning new programming languages,
how to write clean code, how to solve problems with returning algorithms ...



What you Need:
- (PHP 5 >= 5.3.0 and PHPUnit ( >= 3.6, but older versions should work to)



How to play:
- the exercises you will find in the @see document line
  This URL will lead you to the exercise and examples,
  which are written in other programming languages.
  
- build two classes, one plain and one for unittests
- write and start write a unittest
- add code to the plain class until the unittest works
- write next unittest
- change code in plain class until both unittests working
- ... etc pp



Which exercise should the be the first?
- Uncle Bobs PrimeFactors: on his blog you can download an PPT File,
  which show slides how to practice TDD.
