phpCodeKatas is an Collection of Katas written in PHP.

There are a lot of excercises written in other programming languages,
so i decided to rewrite them into PHP.

Its an great training for TDD, learning new programming languages,
how to write clean code, how to solve problems with returning algorithms ...



What you Need:
- (PHP 5 >= 5.3.0 and PHPUnit ( >= 3.6, but older versions should work too)

Please use the bootstrap for testing, e.g. 

phpunit BowlingGame/
or
phpunit ./


How to play:
- the excercises are described in the README files
  
- you starte writing a unittest class with the first test in it
- add code to the target main class until the unittest works
- write next unittest
- change code in plain class until both unittests working
- ... etc pp
- rework the main class, whenever you can (dry)

Which excercise should the be the first?
- Uncle Bobs PrimeFactors: on his blog you can download an PPT File,
  which show slides how to practice TDD.
